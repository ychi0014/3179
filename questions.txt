1. What is a JSON file? Search it online and discuss with your peers.

JSON files are special text files used to store Javascript-like
objects, they are useful formats for enclosing data in a text-like
format to be passed around on the web.

2. How is Vega-lite related to Tamara Munzner's "What? Why? How?"
framework that we learned in the course?

When creating the JSON file for Vega-lite, a number of attributes
identified through the "What? Why? How?" framework are used. For
example, the type of fields (nominal, quantitative), the marks used
(bar), etc.
